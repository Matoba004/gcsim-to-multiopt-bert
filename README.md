## 1. Uploading GCSim Files

### Prerequisites
Before using the conversion tool, you'll need to:

1. Run a simulation in gcsim for your desired character/team
2. Download the sample file (either `.json` or `.gz` format) from the "Sample" tab in gcsim

### Upload Process
1. Visit the [GCSim to GO-MultiOpt](https://thebertdark.github.io/gcsim-to-multiopt/) website
2. Upload your file using one of these methods:
   - Drag and drop your sample file onto the upload area
   - Click on the upload area to browse and select your file

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant "Web Interface"
    participant "File Processor"

    User->>"Web Interface": "Drag file or click upload area"
    "Web Interface"->>"Web Interface": handleDrop or handleFileInput
    "Web Interface"->>"File Processor": "Process file"
    "File Processor"->>"File Processor": read `GZ` or read`JSON`
    "File Processor"->>"Web Interface": "Return processed sample data"
    "Web Interface"->>"User": "Display character selection options"
```

## 2. Selecting Characters and Mods
After uploading your file, the tool will automatically parse it and display available characters from the simulation.

### Character Selection
1. Choose a character from the dropdown menu
   - The dropdown will show all character names detected in your sample file
   - By default, the first character is selected
2. (Optional) Enter a configuration name
   - This will be displayed in Genshin Optimizer when you import the configuration
   - If left blank, it will default to "Powered by DarkJake"

### Mod Selection
The tool displays all available "mods" from your simulation data. Mods represent specific abilities, effects, or buffs that were active during the simulation.
1. By default, all mods are active (included in the conversion)
2. Click on mods you want to ignore/exclude from the conversion
   - Green boxes indicate active mods that will be included
   - Red boxes indicate inactive mods that will be ignored

```mermaid

    A[User Uploads file] --> C{File parsed successfully?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Display character dropdown]
    C -->|No| E[Show error message]
    D --> F[User selects character]
    F --> G[Display available mods]
    G --> H["User toggles mods (optional)"]
    H --> I[User clicks Generate button]
    I --> J[System processes conversion]
```

## 3. Handling Conversion Errors
The tool may encounter errors during the conversion process. These are typically related to unknown abilities, stats, or elements that the converter doesn't recognize.

### Common Error Types

**1. Unknown ability errors**
- When the tool encounters an ability name that isn't in its mapping system
- Example: `Unknown ability "New Character Ability"`

**2. Unknown stat errors**
- When the tool doesn't recognize a stat type in the simulation data
- Example: `Unknown stat "custom_stat"`

**3. Unknown element errors**
- When the tool encounters an element type it doesn't recognize
- Example: `Unknown element "custom_element"`

### Error Resolution
For unknown abilities, you can manually add them to the conversion map:

1. When an error occurs, click on the error to expand it and see details
2. In the textarea below the errors, add a JSON object mapping the unknown ability to its appropriate type and subtype:

```json
{
    "Normal 0": ["normal", "0"],
    "Bake-Kurage": ["skill", "dmg"],
    "Sea-Dyed Foam": ["artifact:OceanHuedClam", "heal"]
}
```
After adding the mapping, click the "Generate" button again to retry the conversion.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Conversion process] --> B{Errors detected?}
    B -- No --> C[Display result]
    B -- Yes --> D[Display error list]
    D --> E[User expands error for details]
    E --> F[User adds custom mapping]
    F --> G[User clicks Generate again]
    G --> A
```

## 4. Using the Results in Genshin Optimizer
Once the conversion is successful, the tool will display the generated `JSON` configuration.

### Copying the Results
1. Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button on the right side of the result box
2. A toast notification will confirm that the content has been copied

3. Scroll down to the "Multi-Optimization Target Config" section
4. Click the "Import Multi-Opt" button
5. Paste the copied JSON into the configuration field
6. Click "Import" to import the configuration
7. Click "Select an Optimization Target" to select the imported configuration
8. Click "Generate Builds" to generate the builds based on the imported configuration

```mermaid
